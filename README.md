Determining the retina damage using OCT scans.

## What is OCT
Optical Coherence Tomography is a technique developed for non-invasive imaging of biological cells extensively used by Ophthalmologists to study the structure of the retina and related diseases. OCT is analogous to ultrasound where it uses low-coherence interferometry to produce a two-dimensional image of optical scattering. It has longitudinal and latitude spatial resolution which is capable of detecting very small reflected signals from retina approximately 10(-10) of the incident optical power

With millions of people across India reporting CNV, DME and Drusen annually, it has become very crucial to detect these disorders on time to start their treatment as some of these can not be cured after a point of time.Currently, trained ophthalmologists clinically examine the presence of any retinal disease like DME, CNV and Drusen. To enable remote identification of diseases and speed up the diagnostic process, automated analysis of OCT images has remained an active field of research since the early days of OCT imaging.We have developed a new intelligent system based on deep learning to automatically categorize OCT images to aid clinicians and make the process faster and more accurate. The framework has the capability to increment diagnostic efficiency, enable easier access to expert knowledge, facilitate remedial decision-making, and decrease overall healthcare costs.
